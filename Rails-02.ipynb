    "\n",
    "Rails imposes a specific architecture on the applications that are built.  This follows a design for interactive applications,\n",
    "proposed in 1979, that breaks the application into 3 kinds of components: models, views and controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* maintain the **state** of the application,\n",
    "transient or permanent, stored outside the application\n",
    "in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* enforces **business rules** that apply to the data,\n",
    "acting as a gatekeeper so that no part of the application can invalidate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### View\n",
    "\n",
    "* generates a **user interface** based on data, \n",
    "possibly several different views of the same data for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* doesn't handle incoming data, just provides ways (forms) for **data input**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "* receives events from the outside world (user input)\n",
    "\n",
    "* interacts with the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* responds by displaying an appropriate view to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The model, view, and controller (MVC) form an application architecture, which typically cycles through\n",
    "the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the browser sends a **request** (URI) to the application\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the controller receives the request, identifies\n",
    "an appropriate **action**, and interacts with the model\n",
    "to retrieve the required data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. the controller invokes an appropriate **view**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. the view renders the next browser screen\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaffolding\n",
    "\n",
    "The **separation of concerns** provided by the MVC\n",
    "architecture allows `rails` to automatically produce template files, using intelligent defaults.  This process is called **scaffolding** and, on the command \n",
    "line, looks as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  rails generate scaffold product name:string price:decimal\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will set up code for all 3 types of components for a data type `product` that is concerned with data/objects that have `name` and `price` attributes.  This is just one example of the `Rails`\n",
    "philosophie of favoring **convention over configuration**."
