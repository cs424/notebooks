    "AJAX is not a technology, but rather a group of technologies.\n",
    "In the article that coined the term Ajax, Jesse James Garrett explained that the following technologies are incorporated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `HTML` (or `XHTML`) and `CSS` for presentation,\n",
    "* The Document Object Model (`DOM`) for dynamic display of and interaction with data,\n",
    "* `JSON` or `XML` for the interchange of data, and `XSLT` for its manipulation,\n",
    "* The `XMLHttpRequest` object for asynchronous communication,\n",
    "* `JavaScript` to bring these technologies together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, however, there have been a number of developments in the technologies used in an Ajax application, and in the definition of the term Ajax itself. `XML` is no longer required for data interchange and, therefore, `XSLT` is no longer required for the manipulation of data. JavaScript Object Notation (`JSON`) is often used as an alternative format for data interchange, although other formats such as preformatted `HTML` or plain text can also be used. A variety of popular `JavaScript` libraries, such as `JQuery`, include abstractions to assist in executing Ajax requests.\n"

    "* Any user whose browser does not support `JavaScript` or `XMLHttpRequest`, or has this functionality disabled, will not be able to properly use pages that depend on Ajax. The only way to let the user carry out functionality is to fall back to non-JavaScript methods. This can be achieved by making sure links and forms can be resolved properly and not relying solely on Ajax.\n",
