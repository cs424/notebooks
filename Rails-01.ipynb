    "In this course we will study the question of _How to develop a database driven web application?_ Examples of such applications abound on the internet: online shops, news sites, blogs and other social networking sites. Typically, such a site consists of a small or large database, and some additional software that provides read or write access to the data through a dynamically created web pages.  Setting up such a site is a complex undertaking, as many different aspects of the application have to be taken care of and connected to each other.\n",
